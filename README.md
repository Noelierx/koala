# Koala üê®
Koala is a macbook case on which you can write and erase ad infinitum. It's a portable whiteboard that protects your computer from any shock. It is entirely designed in France and made from recycled plastic.

Koala is a project conceived as part of my second year of master's degree as Head of Strategy and Digital Innovations. We have received a lot of support and encouragement as well as requests regarding the product.
